Before you begin, make sure that the respondent can clearly see the screen.  After the first number is displayed and the respondent reads it aloud, then the survey will wait 10 SECONDS with the number visible on the screen.  Then the survey will proceed to the next page where the number is no longer visible.  Ask the respondent to recall the digits. YOU should type the respondentâ€™s answer into the entry field then move to the next question. </string>
